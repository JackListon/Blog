## Intro 

This is hopefully the first of many blog posts and not just the result of fleeting motivation. I have a huge list of ideas that I want to do to improve my programming abilities and to pimp out my portfolio. 

As you may have noticed I am using Hugo at the moment to create the site. I am doing this to minimize friction and get my first post out there. One of my many goals is to stamp more of a personal touch on my blog site. I am currently thinking of using this blog as an excuse to research more into web dev and learn more of the basics of hosting a more dynamic site than the ones compiled by Hugo.

Originally I planned on writing this more like a journal. However, I have realized that it is more cathartic for me to write as if I am talking to someone. 

## What to expect
At the moment I plan on posting two types of content to this blog.
### Weekly posts
Every Sunday I plan on posting a weekly summary in which I will discuss the following. 
- Review of the last week.
   - What were my goals for the last week?
   - Did I achieve my goals?
   - What challenges did I encounter and how did I overcome them?
- Plans for the next week.
   - What do I want to do in the next week?
   - What challenges do I expect to face?

### Project Summary
Every time that I finish one of the projects I plan on writing a blog post based on that project. It will most likely be a pretty bog-standard summary of the events. I plan on talking about topics like:

- Learning Resouces Used.
- Summary of each of my sub goals to achieve the projects's completion.
- Summary of some of the challenges I faced.
- My learning outcomes.

## Plans for the next week.
- What do I want to do in the next week?
   - Create a Texas Hold'em Poker odds calculator
      - work on pre flop odds (i.e odds of each 2 card hand)
      - work on post flop odds (i.e rate the value on hand, calculate what percent of potential hands beat that hand)
      - repeat for turn and river.
      - BONUS RONUS: some kind of user interface would be very nice but CLI will do.
   - Create a text wrapper for MetEireanns.ie
      - For use with Nimbus (will update on what Nimbus is in a later post but TLDR, hyper localised weather forecasting using ML)
      - XML is not fun, MetEireann API returns horrifically.
      - Research text wrappers.
      - Create the text wrapper.
      - Research NPM packages.
   - Work on the front end for my weather forecasting application
      - Do more react tutorials.
      - Get the landing page outputting dummy forecasts.
      - Take user input to output the forecast for a user specified date.
- What challenges do I expect to face?
   - With the poker I need to reseach as much as possible into poker theory. I am good at math and compatent in python so the main issues should be the theory behind the calculator
   - With the text wrapper my main issue will be integrating what I have made into my react project as a I am novice at best when it comes to ReactJS.
   - For the front end my main issue will be getting the user input to work with my text wrapper. MetEireann publishes their own forecasts so ultimately I would liek to be able just output those fore a desired date.

## Outro

As you can see this is a pretty normal format for a blog. I will try my best to inject some humor here and there but as a whole, I want to try ad keep these posts informative. I want to use writing this blog as a reason to fully understand the concepts that I am learning. I find the best way to ensure you understand something is by forcing yourself to teach something, and I don't want to annoy my family with coding talk so I decided I would publish my thoughts on the internet instead. I will close this post with my goals for the upcoming week. Thank you for reading.❤️
